## About LibHand

LibHand is an open-source permissively licensed portable library for
rendering articulations of human hand. The goal of LibHand is to provide
as simple programming interface as possible to manipulate human hand pose
information, render a human hand and analyze the resulting image.

Potential scientific applications include computer graphics, computer
vision, robotics, and research into human prosthethic devices. Potential
educational and entertainment applications include integration in interactive
virtual reality applications such as games.

LibHand is available at <http://www.libhand.org/>
Feel free to contact LibHand's author Marin Saric at: marin.saric@gmail.com,
or the LibHand maintainer Shasheen Ediriweera at: shasheene@gmail.com

LibHand is implemented in C++ and offers an interface to facilitate
experimentation. 
By leveraging OGRE, a modern 3D engine, LibHand can render, deform and
analyze a realistic 70k+ triangle hand model at high framerates on mid-range
computer hardware.

LibHand provides OpenCV-friendly interfaces to make it very easy for the
Computer Vision and Robotics community to use it in their research. LibHand
is designed to make it easier to reproduce and extend the research in areas
such as hand grasping, hand pose recognition, hand gesture recognition,
visual servoing, etc.

Additionaly LibHand provides a realistic Human Hand 3D model available in
Blender and OGRE formats under a very permissive [license](#license).

The LibHand was inspired by concepts from recent research in human hand to
robot grasping.

## Installing

### Supported platforms
LibHand v0.9.z is currently actively developed and/or supported on
- Debian Stretch x86_64 and ARMv8-A
- Ubuntu 18.04 x86_64 systems.
- Windows 10 x86_64
- macOS Catalina 10.15 x86_64

Any Debian/Ubuntu derivative (such as Linux Mint) should of course work fine without any modifications to the instructions. See below for detailed instructions.

Other POSIX operating systems, and Linux distributions, CPU architectures etc should work fine, assuming you can satisfying the software dependencies.

LibHand v0.9.z's Matlab bindings are unmaintained. Matlab bindings may either updated or removed entirely in a subsequent LibHand release. See [#6](https://github.com/libhand/libhand/issues/6) for further discussion.

### Software dependencies
LibHand v0.9.0 was released by Marin Saric in 2011 after being developed against following dependencies
- [OpenCV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenCV) (Open Source Computer Vision) v2.3.z
- [OGRE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OGRE) (Object Orientated Graphics Rendering Engine) v1.7.4
	- OpenGL headers (GL/glu.h)
- [Tcl/Tk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tcl) (likely v8.5.z)
- [CMake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CMake) v2.8.6
- [Boost](http://www.boost.org/) (likely v1.46.z)

LibHand v0.9.z is currently developed against the highest common dependency version that is easily accessible on the supported platforms. Building against newer dependency versions may work fine, of course. 

### Building LibHand
- See [Building LibHand on Debian/Ubuntu (and derivatives)](docs/build_instructions/debian/BUILD.DEBIAN.md)
- See [Building LibHand on Windows](docs/build_instructions/windows/BUILD.WINDOWS.md)
- See [Building LibHand on macOS](docs/build_instructions/macos/BUILD.MACOS.md)

# What's contained in this distribution?

Here is a general overview of the LibHand directory structure.

- hand_cpp - compile this first.
 The hand_cpp directory provides the LibHand C++ library and the
 pose_designer utility. 

The pose_designer utility can be used to "test drive" LibHand and experiment
with different hand poses.

- hand_model - this is the main hand 3D data directory. There is a
  "scene_spec.yml" file that is used by the LibHand software to load in the
  hand 3d scene, the hand 3D mesh, textures, skeletons, etc. 

- examples - this directory contains the tutorial code with detailed
  comments. The examples directory requires the hand_cpp directory to be
  compiled and setup first

- hand_matlab - contains the interface code for MATLAB, along with MATLAB
  examples. To compile hand_matlab, you need a recent version of MATLAB that
  is setup to compile with mex. Make sure you can compile C the example code
  that comes with your installation of MATLAB before trying to compile
  the LibHand MATLAB interface. Alternatively, you can download a
  pre-compiled MATLAB binary from <http://www.libhand.org/>

- poses - contains some example hand poses as YAML files, to be used with
  the pose_designer and the example code for both C++ and MATLAB.
